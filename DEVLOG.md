After I read the MuZero paper, this seemed like a critical concept that I didn't know much about relative to other RL and deep RL concepts I have done in the past (Q-learning, DQN, PPO, MLP Actor-Critic).

As I read the MuZero paper, I made the following diagram:

The goal for now is to implement the above diagram, before I (inevitably) struggle and refer to the paper's Python pseudo-code `D:`
